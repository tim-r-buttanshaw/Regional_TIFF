Code used to create the publication Total Income from Farming in the Regions of England 

## Layout of this repo
There are 2 folders in this repo:

* main_page

* individual_regions

These are there to distinguish between the code which is for the summary landing page for the regional TIFF account and the code which is for creating the individual regional code. The files which aren't in either foler represent the files which are needed for both folders to run: 

* imorting and cleaning the data

* creating the numerous specific functions used in order to try and reduce repetition and errors in the code

The approximate data flow is like this:
